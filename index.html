            <h1> Hey there. Welcome </h1>
            <p>I'm Sean Perkins, I'm a game designer and developer from Boise, ID. Since I was a child games have been incredibly important to me, and I started designing
                them when I was about six years old. I started out making my own Pokemon cards on the family computer, then moved on to making horrible boardgames that my grandparents
                graciously played with me. I knew what I wanted to do, long before I had any idea how to do it. <br><br>
                Now 25 years and several detours later I've found my way back to games design. This site serves as a central hub where I can share the projects that I've worked on over the years.
                As well as a space where I can explore and share what I've learned from these experiences. I like to think of it as part blog, part dev log, part philosophical treatise.
